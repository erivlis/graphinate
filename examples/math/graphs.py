    Generate a dictionary of various graph structures and models based on the provided atlas.
    The function creates different types of graphs and models using NetworkX library.
    The generated graphs include Tetrahedron, Cube, Octahedron, Dodecahedron, Icosahedron, Tesseract, Truncated Cube,
    Truncated Tetrahedron, Ladder, Ring, Möbius, Cylinder, Spiral, Spiral Torus, and Circulant[10,[2]].
    Additionally, the function includes adjacency mappings for specific named graphs like
    Buckyball - Truncated Icosahedral Graph, D30 - Rhombic Triacontahedral Graph, Small Rhombicosidodecahedral Graph,
    Small Rhombicuboctahedral Graph, Great Rhombicosidodecahedral Graph, Disdyakis Dodecahedral Graph,
    Deltoidal Icositetrahedral Graph, Icosidodecahedral Graph, Deltoidal Hexecontahedral Graph, Kocohl74,
    Utility Graph, Errara Graph, and Dragon Curve Blob 6.
    The adjacency mappings define the connections between nodes in each named graph.
    The function returns a dictionary
    containing the named graphs as keys and their corresponding NetworkX graph objects as values.
