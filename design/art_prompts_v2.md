# Graphinate 2.0 Art Prompts

This document contains AI image generation prompts for Graphinate's future architecture (Async Ingestion -> GraphEngine -> Reactive Ecosystem).

## Infographic Poster Prompts (Architecture v2)

### 1. The "Blueprint 2.0" (Neon Tech)
```text
"A complex, futuristic technical blueprint infographic for 'Graphinate 2.0'.

Layout: Left-to-Right flow, high information density.
Background: Deep blueprint blue with glowing cyan and white schematic lines.

Section 1 (Left): 'Async Ingestion'.
Multiple parallel streams of data (binary code, API icons) flowing simultaneously into the system, representing asynchronous crawling.

Section 2 (Center): 'The GraphEngine Reactor'.
Instead of a solid box, the core is a transparent, pulsating turbine labeled 'GraphEngine'. It is emitting a continuous stream of individual particles (Events) rather than a static block. Surrounding the core are modular 'Observer' ports plugged into the stream.

Section 3 (Right): 'The Reactive Ecosystem'.
The particle stream splits into three sophisticated outputs:
1. 'Relay API': A perfectly ordered, hexagonal lattice structure representing the standardized GraphQL schema.
2. 'Live Viewer': A holographic monitor showing a graph growing in real-time, with a visible toggle switch for '2D / 3D'.
3. 'Storage': A database cylinder (Neo4j style) absorbing the stream directly.

Style: Engineering schematic, neon glowing lines, precise technical labels.
Vibe: Powerful, real-time, modular, scalable."

### 2. The "Hand-Drawn 2.0" (Da Vinci)
```text
"A detailed, hand-drawn technical infographic poster for 'Graphinate 2.0'.

Layout: Left-to-Right flow.
Style: Realistic pencil sketch on textured off-white paper. Graphite shading, precise engineering lines, cross-hatching.

Section 1 (Left): 'Async Ingestion'.
Multiple parallel, flowing lines sketched rapidly, representing data streams entering the system.

Section 2 (Center): 'The GraphEngine'.
A beautifully detailed, complex mechanical turbine or clockwork heart, drawn with intense precision. It is emitting a stream of small, distinct particles (Events) instead of a solid block.

Section 3 (Right): 'The Ecosystem'.
The particle stream feeds into three distinct, hand-sketched outputs:
1. A geometric, hexagonal lattice structure (Relay API).
2. A sketch of a monitor screen showing a growing graph (Live Viewer).
3. A sturdy, cylindrical storage tank (Database).

Vibe: Leonardo da Vinci's notebook meets modern software architecture. Intellectual, crafted, timeless."

### 3. The "Cyberiad 2.0" (Daniel Mróz)
```text
"A surreal, mechanical infographic poster for 'Graphinate 2.0' in the style of Daniel Mróz (The Cyberiad).

Layout: Left-to-Right flow.
Style: Pen and ink illustration. Heavy cross-hatching, surreal anatomy, Victorian-era mechanical aesthetic mixed with sci-fi.

Section 1 (Left): 'Async Ingestion'.
A multi-armed, grotesque robot conductor frantically directing a chaotic orchestra of flying letters and numbers.

Section 2 (Center): 'The GraphEngine'.
A fantastically impossible machine, part clockwork, part biological, with eyes and steam vents. It is churning the chaos and puffing out perfect, glowing geometric shapes (Events).

Section 3 (Right): 'The Ecosystem'.
The shapes float into space, forming:
1. A crystalline spiderweb city (Relay API).
2. A telescope looking at a new constellation (Live Viewer).
3. A massive, ornate treasure chest swallowing the shapes (Database).

Vibe: Whimsical, philosophical, intricate, bizarre. The magic of engineering."
