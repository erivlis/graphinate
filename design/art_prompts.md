## Logo Prompts

### 1. Minimalist Network
```text
"A modern, minimalist logo for a Python library named 'Graphinate'. The design should combine the concepts of 'Data' and 'Graphs'. Visual elements: A network of connected nodes (dots and lines) emerging or transforming from a structured grid or a block of code. Style: Geometric, clean, and tech-oriented. Colors: Deep purple, electric blue, and white (matching a dark mode IDE theme). The logo should convey synthesis, structure, and elegance. Vector art style, flat design with subtle gradients."
```

### 2. Abstract 'G'
```text
"Logo for 'Graphinate'. An abstract letter 'G' formed by a constellation of connected nodes. The nodes are glowing, suggesting data flow. Dark background. Cyberpunk but professional."
```
