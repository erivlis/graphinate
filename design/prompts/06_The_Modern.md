"A clean, modern productivity infographic poster explaining the architecture of the 'Graphinate' Python library in the style of Notion illustrations.

Layout: Left-to-Right flow.
- Section 1 (Left): 'Sources'. Icons representing APIs, Databases, and Files. Data flowing into a funnel.
- Section 2 (Center): 'The Engine'. A central, glowing core labeled 'GraphModel'. Inside, show Python generator functions transforming data into Nodes and Edges.
- Section 3 (Right): 'Builders'. Three distinct outputs branching out: 1. A NetworkX graph structure. 2. A GraphQL logo labeled "GraphQL API". 3. A 3D Visualization (force-directed graph).

Composition: Left-to-Right flow on a white page.
- Left (Sources): Simple, black-and-white line art illustrations of documents and servers.
